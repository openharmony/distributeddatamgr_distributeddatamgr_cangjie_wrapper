# distributeddatamgr_distributeddatamgr_cangjie_wrapper(beta feature)

## Introduction

The distributeddatamgr_distributeddatamgr_cangjie_wrapper provides persistence of various structured data and synchronization and sharing functions of data between different devices for developers using the Cangjie language for application development on OpenHarmony. The distributeddatamgr_distributeddatamgr_cangjie_wrapper currently under development only supports standard devices.

## System Architecture

**Figure 1** Distributed Data Management Cangjie Wrapper Architecture Diagram

![Distributed Data Management Cangjie Wrapper Architecture Diagram](figures/distributeddatamgr_cangjie_wrapper_architecture.png)

As shown in the architecture diagram:

Interface Layer:

- DataShare Predicates: Provides developers with data query filtering capabilities, supporting the construction of complex query conditions.
  - Comparison Predicates: Supports equal-to conditions.
  - Logical Predicates: Supports AND conditions.
  - Range Predicates: Supports IN conditions.
  - Sorting Functions: Supports ascending and descending order of result sets.
  - Other Functions: Supports pagination queries.
  When developers need to retrieve data without focusing on specific database types, data share predicates can be used as general query conditions, such as [retrieval of photos and videos in albums](https://gitcode.com/openharmony-sig/arkcompiler_cangjie_ark_interop/blob/master/doc/Dev_Guide/source_zh_cn/media/medialibrary/cj-photoAccessHelper-systemAlbum-guidelines.md).

- Distributed KV Database: Provides developers with cross-device distributed data collaboration capabilities, supporting seamless synchronization and sharing of data between multiple devices.
  - Database Management: Supports database creation, closure, deletion, and obtaining identifier IDs of all created databases.
  - Database Operations: Supports database backup and restore operations.
  - Data Operations: Supports addition, deletion, modification, and query of data records.
  - Transaction Support: Supports transaction enabling, commit, and rollback.
  - Data Subscription: Supports subscription and unsubscription of specified types of data changes.
  - Synchronization Function: Supports end-to-end database synchronization.

- User Preferences: Provides developers with lightweight Key-Value data processing capabilities, specifically for persistent storage of application configuration information and user preferences.
  - Database Management: Supports database acquisition, deletion, and removal from cache.
  - Database Operations: Supports clearing all data, obtaining all data, and data persistence.
  - Data Operations: Supports data writing, searching, and deletion.
  - Data Subscription: Supports subscription and unsubscription of data changes based on Key or Value values, with callback triggering after persistent file changes.

- RDB Store: Provides developers with a complete local database management mechanism based on SQLite components, supporting standard relational data models.
  - Database Management: Supports database creation and deletion.
  - Database Operations: Supports database backup and restore operations.
  - Data Operations: Provides addition, deletion, modification, and query of data records.
  - SQL Execution: Supports direct execution of user-defined SQL statements, including table structure definition and data manipulation for complex database operations. Currently, only the creation and deletion of tables via SQL statements are supported.

- Value Bucket: Provides developers with standardized data field type enumeration classes, including Integer, Double, StringValue, and Boolean.

Framework Layer:

- DataShare Predicates Wrapper: Implements data share predicates wrapper based on the underlying data sharing component, providing data share predicates for different query methods.
- Distributed KV Store Wrapper: Implements distributed key-value database wrapper based on the underlying KV database component, providing key-value pair data management capabilities.
- User Preferences Wrapper: Implements preferences wrapper based on the underlying preferences component, providing lightweight Key-Value operations and supporting local applications to store small amounts of data.
- RDB Store Wrapper: Implements relational database wrapper based on the underlying relational database component, providing a database that manages data based on the relational model.
- Value Bucket Wrapper: Implements standardized data field type enumerations.

Dependencies Introduction in Architecture:

- data_share: The DataShare Predicates Wrapper depends on the data_share, which is used to implement filtering conditions for querying data in databases.
- kv_store: The Distributed KV Store Wrapper relies on the kv_store implement distributed collaboration capabilities of databases between different devices.
- preferences: The User Preferences Wrapper depends on the preferences, which is used to implement lightweight local Key-Value type data processing capabilities.
- relational_store: The RDB Store Wrapper relies on the relational_store to implement local relational database management mechanisms.
- ability_cangjie_wrapper: The Distributed KV Store Wrapper, User Preferences Wrapper, and RDB Store Wrapper depend on the application context capability of ability_cangjie_wrapper, which is used for accessing database resources of the current application, among other purposes.
- hiviewdfx_cangjie_wrapper: Framework Layer depends on HiLog capabilities for printing logs at key points.
- cangjie_ark_interop: Framework Layer depends on APILevel class definitions and BusinessException class definitions for API annotation and throwing exceptions to users in error branches.
